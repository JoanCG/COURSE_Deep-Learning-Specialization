# Introductory Notes

The term *Deep Learning* makes reference to **neural networks**, which are models that process input data using so called **neurons**. *Neurons* can be viewed as **processing units**, which transform a given input ($x$) to obtain a desired output ($y$).

Neural networks are **structured in layers**: each layer has different neurons that independently process a given input and pass it onto one or more neurons of the next layer. Complex structures, with several layers of neurons, are the reason for "**Deep** Learning". There are also simple structures, being the most basic one layer with a single neuron. 

The main reason behind Deep Learning success (besides excellent marketing) is that **neural networks yield better results as the amount of data increases**, in contrast with traditional machine learning algorithms. To the date, most of the economic value created by neural networks comes from **supervised learning**, in which there is a labelled output ($y$) for the input ($x$) data. It is important to highlight that all data is not created equal. Some data is structured, but most of it is unstructured: 

- **Structured** or quantitative data  is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms. There are values for defined features (i.e., columns in a dataframe that contain information about the sample) related to each sample in the dataset.  
- **Unstructured** or qualitative data does not have a predefined data model. Instead, features are to be extracted in some way that helps solve the problem in hand. [^1]

# About "Deep Learning Specialization"

According to the [Coursera website](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/208280296-Specializations?language=en_US):

>  "A Coursera Specialization is a series of related courses designed to help you master a specific topic"

The **Deep Learning Specilization** is a series of foundational courses destined to understand theoretical concepts related to Deep Learning (DL), as well as its applications. It is composed of **5 courses** with specific learning goals: 

1. [_Neural Networks and Deep Learning_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning ): the goal is to understand the basics of deep learning, both theoretical and practical, to finally build and train a deep neural network.

2. [_Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning): master practical aspects of DL for optimizing neural networks for our purposes. 

3. [_Structuring Machine Learning Projects_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning): the goal is to learn state of the art techniques to deal with data in DL projects, which presents certain differences compared to previous machine learning projects (i.e. train/test data splits).

4. [_Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning): review this specific type of neural network, which is widely spread (i.e. image recognition).

5. [_Sequence Models_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning): review different models related with Natural Language Processing, shuch as Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Shot Term Memory (LSTM) models.
