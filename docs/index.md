# Deep Learning Specilization

According to the [Coursera website](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/208280296-Specializations?language=en_US):

>  "A Coursera Specialization is a series of related courses designed to help you master a specific topic"

  <br>

The **Deep Learning Specilization** is a series of foundational courses destined to understand theoretical concepts related to Deep Learning (DL), as well as its applications. It is composed of **5 courses** with specific learning goals: 

1. [_Neural Networks and Deep Learning_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning ): the goal is to build and train a deep neural network (as an example, a network able to recognize cat pictures will be built).

2. [_Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning): master practical aspects of DL for optimizing neural networks for our purposes. 

3. [_Structuring Machine Learning Projects_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning): the goal is to learn state of the art techniques to deal with data in DL projects, which presents certain differences compared to previous machine learning projects (i.e. train/test data splits).

4. [_Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning): review this specific type of neural network, which is widely spread (i.e. image recognition).

5. [_Sequence Models_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning): review different models related with Natural Language Processing, shuch as Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Shot Term Memory (LSTM) models.
