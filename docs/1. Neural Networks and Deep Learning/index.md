The term *Deep Learning* referes to training **neural networks**, which are models that process input data using so called **neurons**. *Neurons* are functions that process a given input ($x$) to obtain a desired output ($y$). 

Neural networks can have a single neuron (most simple structure), or stack several neurons, becoming more complex. 

The neurons can directly process the input features into the desired output, but they can also "pass" their outputs to another neurons. 

The *depth* of a neural network comes from the number of neuron *layers* (stacked neurons). 

Given enough examples of $x$ and $y$ (**training data**), the neural network are good at figuring out the functions each neuron of the network needs to accurately map from $x$ to $y$. 

All the economic value created by neural networks comes from **supervised learning**. In this type of machine learning, you have some input ($x$) and some output ($y$).

All data is not created equal. Some data is structured, but most of it is unstructured:   

- **Structured** or quantitative data  is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms. There are values for defined features (i.e., columns in a dataframe that contain information about the sample) related to each sample in the dataset.
- **Unstructured** or qualitative data does not have a predefined data model. Instead, features are to be extracted in some way that helps solve the problem in hand. [^1]
